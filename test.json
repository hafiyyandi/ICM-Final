What?\r\nThen you come around again and say\r\nBaby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change; trust me\r\nRemember how that lasted for a day?\r\nI say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you\r\n\r\nOoh we called it off again last night\r\nBut ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you\r\n\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\r\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\r\nLike ever\r\n\r\nI'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me\r\nFalling for it screaming that I'm right and you\r\nWould hide away and find your piece of mind\r\nWith some indie record that's much cooler than mine\r\n\r\nOoh, you called me up again tonight\r\nBut ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you\r\n\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\r\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\r\n\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, oh!\r\n\r\nI used to think that we were forever ever\r\nAnd I used to say, Never say never\r\nHuh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you\r\nAnd I'm like, I just, I mean this is exhausting, you know\r\nLike, we are never getting back together, like ever\r\n\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\r\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\r\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\r\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together"
